# Skeleton-Based Animation Autoencoder

This deep neural network (DNN) is trying to learn an approximation to the identity function, so as to output x^ that is similar to x.

* src/motion:  A helper library for dealing with motion data
* src/autoenc_train.py: the training of the autoencoder TODO
* src/autoenc.py: the runnning of the autoencoder TODO
